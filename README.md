# housepricesv1
The first notebook version of House Prices Competiton on Kaggle
I used NN with 4 hidden layers (268 -> 512 -> 256 -> 128 -> 64 -> 1) with 20 epochs
Optimizer - Adam, (lr = 0.0005), without scheduler 
Loss Function - MSE


Score is not the best, but anyway it works (I've got 0.19005)
